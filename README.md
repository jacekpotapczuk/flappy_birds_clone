# Flappy Bird Clone

You can find apk version in builds folder. Because of my limited resources it was tested only on 360x740 resolution. If 
you don't want to download anything below is the link to youtube where you can watch short gameplay.


## Personal Notes

This project was part of my challange to make a game in 24h (over 7 days). Flappy bird is game with very simple gameplay, but I'm happy with the overall effect. After first hours I thought to myself that almost everything is ready and that I would have nothing to do in the remaining time. 
That's why I've added more and more features and had time to focus on details. 
At the end I actually had to limit my ideas because 24h mark was coming.
